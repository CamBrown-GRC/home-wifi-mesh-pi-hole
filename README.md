# Secure Home Network with TP-Link Mesh Wi-Fi and Pi-hole Ad Blocking
## üìî Overview
- This project documents my implementation of a secure home network using a TP-Link Deco XE75 mesh Wi-Fi system combined with Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. The setup is designed to improve performance, reduce tracking/ads, and enhance local network security.

---

## üéØ Goals  
- Replace ISP Wi-Fi with a more secure and scalable mesh system  
- Deploy **network-wide ad blocking** with Pi-hole DNS  
- Segment IoT and personal devices for better hygiene  
- Learn and apply core networking and security concepts  
- Document the project as a cybersecurity portfolio item

## üîê Security Considerations  
- WPA2/WPA3-Personal enabled on all SSIDs  
- **UPnP disabled** on both ISP router and Deco system  
- **IoT devices isolated** using Deco's "IoT Network" feature  
- Admin passwords changed from factory defaults  
- Pi-hole admin interface protected with password  
- DNS queries logged locally; no external analytics services used  
- Static IP assigned to Raspberry Pi for DNS reliability  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Highlights  

- Pi-hole set as primary DNS via Deco app (`More > DHCP Server`)  
- Static IP reservation for Pi-hole on the Deco network  
- Custom blocklists added to Pi-hole:  
  - [StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts)  
  - [OISD blocklist](https://oisd.nl)  
- Pi-hole admin panel configured for local access only

## üß™ Lessons Learned  
- Deepened understanding of DNS, DHCP, and local IP routing  
- Practiced segmenting network zones for better security  
- Learned the value of DNS filtering for threat reduction  
- Reinforced basic GRC principles like least privilege and control documentation  

---

## üìå Next Steps  
- Integrate **Prometheus + Grafana** for network visualization  
- Set up basic log forwarding to a centralized logging system  
- Explore moving from IoT isolation to VLAN segmentation with Unifi or pfSense  
- Create risk register and policy documentation to complement GRC learning

## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me  
I recently passed the [ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cc) exam and am actively pursuing entry and junior-level cybersecurity and GRC roles.  
This project is part of my personal initiative to build technical skills and document them publicly.
